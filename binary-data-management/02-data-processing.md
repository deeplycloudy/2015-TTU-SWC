## Binary file formats

We can guess from the `.nc` extension that we are dealing with a Network Common Data Form (netCDF) file. 
It's also compressed, hence the `.gz`. 
Had we actually downloaded the file to our computer and uncompressed it, 
our initial impulse might have been to type, 

~~~
!cat IMOS_ACORN_V_20121001T000000Z_TURQ_FV00_monthly-1-hour-avg_END-20121029T180000Z_C-20121030T160000Z.nc
~~~

but such a command would produce an incomprehensible mix symbols and letters. 
The reason is that up until now, 
we have been dealing with [text files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file). 
These consist of a simple sequence of character data 
(represented using ASCII, Unicode, or some other standard) 
separated into lines, 
meaning that text files are human-readable when opened with a text editor or displayed using `cat`. 

All other file types (including netCDF) are known collectively as [binary files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file). 
They tend to be smaller and faster for the computer to interpret than text files, 
but the payoff is that they aren't human-readable unless you have the right intpreter 
(e.g. `.doc` files aren't readable with your text editor and must instead be opened with Microsoft Word). 
To view the contents of a netCDF file we'd need to use a special command line utility called 
[`ncdump`](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf/ncdump.html), 
which is included with the netCDF C software 
(i.e. if you're using any software that knows how to deal with netCDF - 
such as the Anaconda scientific Python distribution used in Software Carpentry workshops -
then you probably have `ncdump` installed without even knowing it).   

For this example, however, we haven't actually downloaded the netCDF file to our machine. 
Instead, IMOS has made the data available via a THREDDS server, 
which means we can just pass a URL to the `netCDF4.Dataset` function in order to obtain the data.

    abstract: These data have not been quality controlled. The ACORN facility is producing NetCDF files with radials data for each station every ten minutes.  Radials represent the surface sea water state component  along the radial direction from the receiver antenna  and are calculated from the shift of an area under  the bragg peaks in a Beam Power Spectrum.  The radial values have been calculated using software provided  by the manufacturer of the instrument. eMII is using a Matlab program to read all the netcdf files with radial data for two different stations  and produce a one hour average product with U and V components of the current. The final product is produced on a regular geographic (latitude longitude) grid More information on the data processing is available through the IMOS MEST  http://imosmest.aodn.org.au/geonetwork/srv/en/main.home. This file is an aggregation over a month of distinct hourly averaged files.

The great thing about netCDF files is that they contain metadata - 
that is, data about the data. 
There are global attributes that give information about the file as a whole 
(shown above - we will come back to these later), 
while each variable also has its own attributes.

~~~ {.python}
print 'The file contains the following variables:'
print acorn_DATA.variables.keys()
~~~

~~~ {.output}
The file contains the following variables:
[u'LATITUDE', u'LONGITUDE', u'LATITUDE_quality_control', u'LONGITUDE_quality_control', u'TIME', u'SPEED', u'UCUR', u'VCUR', u'TIME_quality_control', u'SPEED_quality_control', u'UCUR_quality_control', u'VCUR_quality_control']
~~~

(The 'u' means each variable name is represented by a Unicode string.)

~~~ {.python}
print 'These are the attributes of the time axis:'
print acorn_DATA.variables['TIME']
print 'These are some of the time values:'
print acorn_DATA.variables['TIME'][0:10]
~~~

~~~ {.output}
These are the attributes of the time axis:
<type 'netCDF4.Variable'>
float64 TIME(TIME)
    standard_name: time
    long_name: time
    units: days since 1950-01-01 00:00:00

    calendar: gregorian
    comment: Given time lays at the middle of the averaging time period.
    local_time_zone: 8.0
unlimited dimensions: 
current shape = (493,)
filling off

These are some of the time values:
[ 22919.          22919.04166667  22919.08333333  22919.125       22919.16666667

~~~ 

The raw time values are fairly meaningless, 
but we can use the time attributes to convert them to a more meaningful format...

~~~ {.python}
from netCDF4 import num2date
units = acorn_DATA.variables['TIME'].units
calendar = acorn_DATA.variables['TIME'].calendar

times = num2date(acorn_DATA.variables['TIME'][:], units=units, calendar=calendar)
print times[0:10]

## Calculating the current speed

For the sake of example, 
let's say that our data file contained the zonal (east/west; 'UCUR') and meridional (north/south; 'VCUR') surface current components, 
but not the total current speed. 
To calculate it, 
we first need to assign a variable to the zonal and meridional current data.

~~~ {.python}
uData = acorn_DATA.variables['UCUR'][:,:,:]
vData = acorn_DATA.variables['VCUR'][:,:,:]
~~~

Both `uData` and `vData` are a special type of numpy array 
(which we have met previously) known as a masked array, 
whereby some of the points in the time/latitude/longitude grid have missing (or masked) values. 
Just as with a normal numpy array, 
we can check the shape of our data 
(in fact, masked arrays can do everything normal numpy arrays can do and more).

~~~ {.python}
print type(uData)
print uData.shape
~~~

~~~ {.output}
<class 'numpy.ma.core.MaskedArray'>
(493, 55, 57)
~~~

In other words, 493 time steps, 55 latitudes and 57 longitudes. 
We can now go ahead and calculate the current speed.

~~~ {.python}
spData = (uData**2 + vData**2)**0.5
~~~

### Viewing the result

It's a good idea to regularly view your data throughout the code development process, 
just to ensure nothing that crazy has happened along the way. 
Below is a code except from 
[this example](https://github.com/aodn/imos-user-code-library/blob/master/Python/demos/acorn.py) 
in the AODN user code library, 
which simply plots one of the 493 timesteps.

~~~ {.python}
%matplotlib inline
from matplotlib.pyplot import figure, pcolor, colorbar, xlabel, ylabel, title, draw, quiver, show, savefig

LAT = acorn_DATA.variables['LATITUDE']
LON = acorn_DATA.variables['LONGITUDE']
TIME = acorn_DATA.variables['TIME']

# Only one time value is being plotted. modify timeIndex if desired (value between 0 and length(timeData)-1 )
timeIndex = 4
speedData = spData[timeIndex,:,:]
latData = LAT[:]
lonData = LON[:]

# sea water U and V components
uData = acorn_DATA.variables['UCUR'][timeIndex,:,:]
vData = acorn_DATA.variables['VCUR'][timeIndex,:,:]
units = acorn_DATA.variables['UCUR'].units

figure1 = figure(figsize=(13, 10), dpi=80, facecolor='w', edgecolor='k')
pcolor(lonData , latData, speedData)
cbar = colorbar()
cbar.ax.set_ylabel('Current speed in ' + units)

title(acorn_DATA.title + '\n' + num2date(TIME[timeIndex], TIME.units, TIME.calendar).strftime('%d/%m/%Y'))
xlabel(LON.long_name + ' in ' + LON.units)
ylabel(LAT.long_name + ' in ' + LAT.units)

# plot velocity field
Q = quiver(lonData[:], latData[:], uData, vData, units='width')
show()
~~~

> Quite a few lines of code were required to create our publication quality figure using [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/),

>
> Let's say (hypothetically) that the TURQ site radar has been found to be unreliable for surface current speeds greater than 0.9 m/s.
> To correct for this problem,

>                 spData[t, y, x] = 0.9
