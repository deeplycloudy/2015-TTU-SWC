<h2 id="binary-file-formats">Binary file formats</h2>
<p>We can guess from the <code>.nc</code> extension that we are dealing with a Network Common Data Form (netCDF) file. It's also compressed, hence the <code>.gz</code>. Had we actually downloaded the file to our computer and uncompressed it, our initial impulse might have been to type,</p>
<pre><code>!cat IMOS_ACORN_V_20121001T000000Z_TURQ_FV00_monthly-1-hour-avg_END-20121029T180000Z_C-20121030T160000Z.nc</code></pre>
<p>but such a command would produce an incomprehensible mix symbols and letters. The reason is that up until now, we have been dealing with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file">text files</a>. These consist of a simple sequence of character data (represented using ASCII, Unicode, or some other standard) separated into lines, meaning that text files are human-readable when opened with a text editor or displayed using <code>cat</code>.</p>
<p>All other file types (including netCDF) are known collectively as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file">binary files</a>. They tend to be smaller and faster for the computer to interpret than text files, but the payoff is that they aren't human-readable unless you have the right intpreter (e.g. <code>.doc</code> files aren't readable with your text editor and must instead be opened with Microsoft Word). To view the contents of a netCDF file we'd need to use a special command line utility called <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf/ncdump.html"><code>ncdump</code></a>, which is included with the netCDF C software (i.e. if you're using any software that knows how to deal with netCDF - such as the Anaconda scientific Python distribution used in Software Carpentry workshops - then you probably have <code>ncdump</code> installed without even knowing it).</p>
<p>For this example, however, we haven't actually downloaded the netCDF file to our machine. Instead, IMOS has made the data available via a THREDDS server, which means we can just pass a URL to the <code>netCDF4.Dataset</code> function in order to obtain the data.</p>

    abstract: These data have not been quality controlled. The ACORN facility is producing NetCDF files with radials data for each station every ten minutes.  Radials represent the surface sea water state component  along the radial direction from the receiver antenna  and are calculated from the shift of an area under  the bragg peaks in a Beam Power Spectrum.  The radial values have been calculated using software provided  by the manufacturer of the instrument. eMII is using a Matlab program to read all the netcdf files with radial data for two different stations  and produce a one hour average product with U and V components of the current. The final product is produced on a regular geographic (latitude longitude) grid More information on the data processing is available through the IMOS MEST  http://imosmest.aodn.org.au/geonetwork/srv/en/main.home. This file is an aggregation over a month of distinct hourly averaged files.

<h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin"></span>Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata convention</h2>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>When performing simple data analysis tasks on netCDF files, command line tools like the Climate Data Operators (<a href="https://code.zmaw.de/projects/cdo">CDO</a>)<br />are often a better alternative to writing your own functions in Python. However, let's put ourselves in the shoes of the developers of CDO for a minute. In order to calculate the time mean of a dataset for a given start and end date (for example), CDO must first identify the units of the time axis. This isn't as easy as you'd think, since the creator of the netCDF file could easily have called the <code>units</code> attribute <code>measure</code>, or <code>scale</code>, or something else completely unpredictable. They could also have defined the units as <code>weeks since 1-01-01 00:00:00</code> or <code>milliseconds after 1979-12-31</code>. Obviously what is needed is a standard method for defining netCDF attributes, and that’s where the <a href="http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/">Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata convention</a> comes in.</p>
<p>The CF metadata standard was first defined back in the early 2000s and has now been adopted by all the major institutions and projects in the weather/climate sciences. There's a nice <a href="http://drclimate.wordpress.com/2014/06/09/are-you-cf-compliant/">blog post</a> on the topic if you'd like more information, but for the most part you just need to be aware that if a tool like CDO isn't working, it might be because your netCDF file isn't CF compliant.</p>

<h2 id="calculating-the-current-speed">Calculating the current speed</h2>
<p>For the sake of example, let's say that our data file contained the zonal (east/west; 'UCUR') and meridional (north/south; 'VCUR') surface current components, but not the total current speed. To calculate it, we first need to assign a variable to the zonal and meridional current data.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">uData = acorn_DATA.variables[<span class="st">&#39;UCUR&#39;</span>][:,:,:]
vData = acorn_DATA.variables[<span class="st">&#39;VCUR&#39;</span>][:,:,:]</code></pre>
<p>Both <code>uData</code> and <code>vData</code> are a special type of numpy array (which we have met previously) known as a masked array, whereby some of the points in the time/latitude/longitude grid have missing (or masked) values. Just as with a normal numpy array, we can check the shape of our data (in fact, masked arrays can do everything normal numpy arrays can do and more).</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="dt">print</span> <span class="dt">type</span>(uData)
<span class="dt">print</span> uData.shape</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>&lt;class &#39;numpy.ma.core.MaskedArray&#39;&gt;
(493, 55, 57)</code></pre>
<p>In other words, 493 time steps, 55 latitudes and 57 longitudes. We can now go ahead and calculate the current speed.</p>

<h3 id="viewing-the-result">Viewing the result</h3>
<p>It's a good idea to regularly view your data throughout the code development process, just to ensure nothing that crazy has happened along the way.

<p>Quite a few lines of code were required to create our publication quality figure using <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>, and there would have been even more had we wanted to use the <a href="http://matplotlib.org/basemap/">basemap</a> library to plot coastlines or change the map projection. Recognising this burden, the team at the UK Met Office have developed <a href="http://scitools.org.uk/iris/">Iris</a> and <a href="http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/">Cartopy</a>, which build on matplotlib and basemap to provide a more convenient interface (read: shorter, less complex code) for plotting in the weather, climate and ocean sciences.</p>
<p>The easiest way to install Iris and Cartopy is to use the <a href="http://www.continuum.io/blog/conda">conda</a> package installer that comes with Anaconda. Simply enter the following at the command line:</p>
<pre><code>conda install -c scitools iris</code></pre>
<p>What if you want to view the contents of a netCDF file quickly, rather than go to the effort of producing something that is publication quality? There are numerous tools out there for doing this, including <a href="http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/">Panoply</a> and <a href="http://uvcdat.llnl.gov/">UV-CDAT</a>.</p>

<p>Let's say (hypothetically) that the TURQ site radar has been found to be unreliable for surface current speeds greater than 0.9 m/s. To correct for this problem, the IMOS documentation suggests setting all values greater than 0.9 m/s, back to 0.9 m/s. The most obvious solution to this problem would be to loop through every element in <code>spData</code> and check its value:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">for</span> t in <span class="dt">range</span>(<span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dt">len</span>(TIME[:])):
    <span class="kw">for</span> y in <span class="dt">range</span>(<span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dt">len</span>(LAT[:])):
        <span class="kw">for</span> x in <span class="dt">range</span>(<span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dt">len</span>(LON[:])):
            <span class="kw">if</span> spData[t, y, x] &gt; <span class="fl">0.9</span>:
                spData[t, y, x] = <span class="fl">0.9</span></code></pre>
<p>The problem is that not only is this nested loop kind of ugly, it's also pretty slow. If our data array was even larger (e.g. like the huge data arrays that high resolution global climate models produce), then it would probably be prohibitively slow. The reason is that <em>high level</em> languages like Python and Matlab are built for usability (i.e. they make it easy to write concise, readable code), not speed. To get around this problem, people have written Python libraries (like <code>numpy</code>) in <em>low level</em> languages like C and Fortran, which are built for speed (but definitely not usability). Fortunately we don't ever need to see the C code under the hood of the <code>numpy</code> library, but we should use it to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming">vectorise</a> our array operations whenever possible.</p>
<p>With this in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>numpy.ma.where()</code> function to correct all values in <code>spData</code> greater than 0.9 (hint: you'll need to <code>import numpy.ma</code>)</li>
<li>Use the <code>%timeit</code> cell magic to compare the speed of your answer to the nested loop described above</li>
</ul>
